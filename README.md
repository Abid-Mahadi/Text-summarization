From my perspective, when I started to research. I was confused, which topics I should choose? Then I started to research it.  I found so many topics in NLP, but the problem is, every topic is in a stable phase. I was worried about it. After that, I found text summarization and it was not in a stable phase. Because text summarization has no accurate answer that can measure, how much good your model. And also this was a challenging topic. I got inspiration.

Another thing I found that in my country there was no better model published. So the first thing in any research is, "Is this topic already in a stable phase?". Still, text summarization is an amazing topic for research.
